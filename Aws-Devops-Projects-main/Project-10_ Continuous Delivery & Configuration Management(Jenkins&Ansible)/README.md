# Project-10: Continuous Delivery & Configuration Management (Jenkins&Ansible)

[_Project Source_](https://www.udemy.com/course/devopsprojects/?src=sac&kw=devops+projects)

####
Starting the new year with Ansible,

but before I liter your timeline with my projects.

I want to say a Happy New Year Guys!!.

Curently, I have been learning ansible and on this project I combined the power of Jenkins and Ansible in extension to my prevoius CI project "Project 5", using ansible to stage and deploy the pipeline to production environment.

ðŸ©¸ Developer makes code changes, which is detected by Jenkins and fetches all changes made.

ðŸ©¸ Jenkins runs code/unit test and if passed or failed sends a notification to slack, but if passed continues on the next job which is code analysis using checkstyle and sonarqube scanner and the report forwarded to our sonarqube server.

ðŸ©¸ Sonarqube server compares this result with quality gates abd if passed next job gets triggered with MAVEN building our artifact and dependencies downloaded from our nexus repo.

ðŸ©¸ Artifact gets packaged and uploaded to nexus repo if passed.

ðŸ©¸ ANSIBLE downloads the artifact from nexus and deploys it to our staging environment while making sure the right packages and services are installed.

ðŸ©¸ Ansible will roll back to its previous state if the the stage fails.

ðŸ©¸ If passed and done, sofware testing and DevQ gets executed.

ðŸ©¸ If approved, Ansible is used to deploy the artifact to our production server.
