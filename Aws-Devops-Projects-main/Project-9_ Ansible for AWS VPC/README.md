# Project-9: Ansible for AWS VPC

### For this project, I created a VPC in AWS using Ansible as a Configuration Management tool.

This was fun to do...

###

- Installed ansibled and configured it for use on ec2 server.

- Created variable files and playbooks specifying the list of cloud modules.

- Installed boto 3 for ansible's use.

- Made API connection to aws cloud usin IAM roles.

- Created VPC in 3 Zones with internet gateway and route table connections also
  creating private subnets

- Created NAT Gateway ith RT connections and also Bastion Host.

- Created Keypair and SG for the Bastion Host.
