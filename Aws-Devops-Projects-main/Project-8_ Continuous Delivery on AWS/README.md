## For this project, I included continous delivery (CD) to my previous CI project "project 6" using just AWS services.

So basically,

ğŸ”¨ Developers makes regular code commits that triggers our pipeline

ğŸ”¨ Commit happens on AWS codebuild, triggering AWS codebuild

ğŸ”¨ Codebuild does code analysis (sonar scanner)

ğŸ”¨ Dependencies needed are downloaded from AWS codeartifact

ğŸ”¨ Code build runs MAVEN to build artifact

ğŸ”¨ Artifact is stored in an s3 bucket

ğŸ”¨ "AWS deploy" deploys our artifact to beanstalk environment

ğŸ”¨ Beanstalk will be connected to RDS

ğŸ”¨ SoftWare Testing will be executed from AWS codebuild service which will come after our "Deploy" stage

## For This Project,

ğŸ’Š I created Beanstalk And RDS

ğŸ’Š Deployed DB in RDS

ğŸ’Š Created a Deply Job for Beanstalk

ğŸ’Š Created a Job Build to test our software

ğŸ’Š Our output and snapshot was uploaded to s3 bucket
