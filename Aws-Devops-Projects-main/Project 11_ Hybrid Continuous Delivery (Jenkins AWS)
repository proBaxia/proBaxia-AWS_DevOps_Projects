###
I worked on a hybrid continuous delivery project using just JENKINS and AWS.
This is project is also an extension of my previous CI Pipeline.


For this project, I used the following tools.

🛠️ Jenkins for CI
🛠️ Nexus sonatype repo for artifact storage and download.
🛠️ sonarqube server for sonar analysis.
🛠️ Maven to build artifact.
🛠️ Git as Version control.
🛠️ Slack for Notification.
🛠️ Beanstalk for deployment using AWS CLI in Jenkins.
🛠️ AWS s3 for uploading our artifact

- AWS CLI running from jenkins will upload the artifact to the s3 bucket and then update the beanstalk environment with the new artifact downloaded from the s3 bucket.

To achieve this ..

🩸 Created Elastic Beanstalk Application with two environments: Stage & Prod
🩸 Created an IAM user with S3 and Beanstalk permissions
🩸 Added IAM user credentials to Jenkins for AWS CLI
🩸 Created an S3 bucket to store build artifacts
🩸 Created new Jenkinsfiles for Stage/Prod pipelines
🩸 Created two pipelines in Jenkins for Continuous Delivery
