Deploying Java Web Application On Kubernetes Cluster.
I deployed a containerized web app on Kubernetes for production in this project with the following steps:
ğŸ©¸Created and prepared Kubernetes deployment environment using kops.
ğŸ©¸ Created EBS volume to run my DB pod
ğŸ©¸ Labelled nodes with zone names, so I can select the node based on the zone when running my DB pod.
ğŸ©¸ Wrote Kubernetes definition files to create objects on Kubernetes cluster using >Deployment>Service>Secret<Volume.

Please refer to the links for detailed steps and source files.
